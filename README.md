# Anilib

This a local anime streaming platform, that uses [AniList API](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) as anime data source (For the metadata)

It was created using react, next, tailwind, trpc, prisma and sqlite

It's on early stage and it's a moving target so use it with a lot love and care with your library
